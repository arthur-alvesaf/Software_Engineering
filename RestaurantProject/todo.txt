Sprint 1.

1. Table creation/deletion will be part of admin interface, so it needs to get removed from there.
2. Some methods like displaying the recipes or clearing the window should become helper methods since they are called from different classes. Make a complete helper file.
3. Implement the login (part of it is in the Worker class, but should be moved from there).
4. The cost of the products will be calculated according to the ingredients it has. This should be completed in later sprint.
